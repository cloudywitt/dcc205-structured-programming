# DCC205: Structured Programming (2023.1)

It contais all of my codes written for my College's Structured Programming course, lectured by Professor Maely da Silva Moraes. All the solutions were written in C, using VS Code as IDE and GCC as compiler.

## What is Structured Programming?
Structured Programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on structured control flow statements to enhance code readability and quality. It gained popularity after the very influential open letter "Go To Statement Considered Harmful", written by the Dutch Computer Scientist Edgar Dijkstra. In the letter, Dijkstra criticized the goto statement for being unnecessary and bad for code clarity and defended the use of loops and other structured control statements instead — just like we do now.
